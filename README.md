Hello and welcome to my GitHub, ByJove! 
I am a female cybersecurity analyst student and this repository is a collection of my write-ups on various topics related to cybersecurity.

In this repository, you will find a curated collection of simple, fun, and well-broken-down write-ups on various topics ranging from CVE, vulnHub, CTFs, Hack the box walkthroughs, real-life encounters, and everything in between. 
These write-ups are designed to help other cybersecurity enthusiasts learn and grow in their knowledge and skills, without feeling overwhelmed or intimidated.

I believe that learning should be enjoyable and accessible to everyone, which is why I've made sure that my write-ups are easy to follow.
Each write-up is broken down into clear, concise steps, making it easy for you to follow along and also fun to read.
I've added a touch of personality to my write-ups, making them enjoyable to read and learn from and also  I've taken the time to explain complex concepts in a way that's easy to understand, so you can focus on learning and not get bogged down in technical jargon.
                                                                                              

Feel free to browse through the repository and read the write-ups that interest you. Each write-up is organized by topic and contains a detailed explanation of the concepts and techniques used. You can also use the search bar at the top of the page to find specific write-ups.


If you have any write-ups that you would like to contribute to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request. I am always looking for new and interesting write-ups to add to the collection.
